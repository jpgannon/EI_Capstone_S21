\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 There are the raw data files \'96 seems like the students are going for near-real-time visualization in their projects. For precip, \'93ReportPCP\'94 has the precip sum for the interval in cm. For the weirs, we calculate Q (ft^3/sec) and specific discharge (mm/hr) right in the logger code so they are available alongside stage height. These are the raw data files and require quite a bit of QC before we publish \'96 we also re-calculate discharge and apply a low flow correction, etc., when we QC. But seeing these real time raw data is super useful even though we know there are errors to find. }
