# This is where the meaning of the columns in the data is stored.(Data Dictionary)

Water_table_WS3upper_WS_3Up_snowdat_15min.dat  (Snow Data from Watershed 3 15 minute increments)

TIMESTAMP (time) - the timestamp of the time the data was collected
RECORD (integer) - the record number, assigns a number to each record (?)
Batt_Volt (volts) - the voltage of the battery that powers the sensor (?)
ptemp (celcius) - temperature measurement, I think it means potential temperature (?)
H2O_Content_1 (vwc) - Volumetric water content 1 (I think it measures the percentage of water in some medium)
H2O_Content_2 (vwc) - Volumetric water content 2 (I think it measures the percentage of water in some medium)
Avg_Period_1 (usec) - units per second of something (?)
Avg_Period_2 (usec) - units per second of something (?)
RTD(1) - Resistance Temperature Detector 1
RTD(2) - Resistance Temperature Detector 2
RTD(3) - Resistance Temperature Detector 3
RTD(4) - Resistance Temperature Detector 4
RTD(5) - Resistance Temperature Detector 5
RTD(6) - Resistance Temperature Detector 6
RTD(7) - Resistance Temperature Detector 7
RTD(8) - Resistance Temperature Detector 8
RTD(9) - Resistance Temperature Detector 9
Air_TempC_Avg (celcius) - the average temperature, I’m assuming it’s averaging the 9 temperatures from columns RTD1-9
Depthraw - snow depths in a unit of measurement that is not listed
Depthscaled (cm) - snow depths in centimeters

Water_table_WS3upper_WS_3Up_snowdat_hr.dat (Snow Data from Watershed 3 Hourly)

TIMESTAMP (time) - the timestamp of the time the data was collected
RECORD (integer) - the record number, assigns a number to each record (?)
H2O_Content_1_Avg (vwc) - Volumetric water content 1 (I think it measures the percentage of water in some medium)
H2O_Content_2_Avg (vwc) - Volumetric water content 2 (I think it measures the percentage of water in some medium)
Avg_Period_1_Avg (usec) - units per second of something (?)

Water_table_WS3upper_WS_3Up_wells.dat (Ground Water Sensor from Watershed 3)

TIMESTAMP (time) - the timestamp of the time the data was collected
RECORD (integer) - the record number, assigns a number to each record (?)
Batt_Volt (volt) - the voltage of the battery that powers the sensor (?)
ptemp_Max (celcius) - temperature measurement, I think it means max potential temperature (?)
WS3_N1_psi (psi) - the pressure of the water or soil in PSI (?)
WS3_N1_rawdepth (cm) - the depth of the water in cm (?)
WS3_N1_depth_corr - the depth of the water in some unknown units
WS3_N1_corr_depth (cm) - the depth of the water in cm
WS3_N1_welltemp (celcius) - temperature in Celsius of the water (?)
WS3_N2_psi (psi) - pressure of water in the soil PSI 2 (?)
WS3_N2_rawdepth (cm) - the depth of the water in cm 2 (?)
WS3_N2_depth_corr - the depth of the water in some unknown units 2
WS3_N2_corr_depth (cm) - the depth of the water in cm
WS3_N2_welltemp (celcius) - temperature in Celsius of the water (?)
WS3_42_4_d2_psi (psi) - pressure of the water or soil, maybe this is the average of the two numbers (?)
WS3_42_4_d2_rawdepth (cm) - depth of water in cm maybe average (?)
WS3_42_4_d2_depth_corr - depth of water in unknown units maybe average (?)

#Watershed 9 has the data in the same format applied to watershed 9

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
